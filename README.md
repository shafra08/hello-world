Yes I am, what else do you want to know; my PP says I am 5'4, I beg to differ. I debug code, working maintenance for an IT firm..eventually, I am thinking data analysis would not be a bad move, I just need to learn to contain my excitement when I think I've stumbled into an inconsistency..I tend to conclude prematurely, which is not so great for data analysis.
